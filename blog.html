        <p>
            The AES is a commonly used encryption standard which was adopted by the United States Government following a NIST competition.
            Its predecessor, DES or the Digital Encryption Standard, had been shown to be vulnerable to several types of attacks and a complete
            crack of the DES cipher was considered imminent. The cipher which won the NIST competition to become the AES was the Rijndael cipher.
            Designed by two Belgian cryptographers, Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen, the Rijndael cipher won out over fifteen serious competitors
            which also met the NIST requirements for entry.  After being ratified by NIST it was accepted by the US Government in 2002 as a federal
            standard.

        <h3>A High-Level Overview</h3>
        <p>
            AES works by applying a repetitive process to a block of 128 bits of data. This process allows the data to be diffused sufficiently far
            from its original state as well as encrypted multiple times using multiple keys (referred to as round keys in the cipher). Typically the
            process starts by obtaining 128, 192 or 256 bits of secure random data from an SPRNG which are used as the private key of the encryption.
            The key is then subjected to a process known as key expansion where the original key is used to generate 10, 12 or 14 round keys depending
            on the length of the private key.  Once these keys are derived the actual encryption begins.
        </p>
        <p>
            First the private key is applied to the current block (I will go over what "applied" entails later), this comprises the complete first
            round of encryption.  Next the block undergoes three processes to diffuse the data, 1) Substitute bytes, 2) Shift rows, 3) Mix columns;
            after these three processes complete the next round key is applied and the cycle begins again. This cycle occurs a total of 9, 11 or 13
            times depending on the key size in question. Finally, for the last round, the substitute bytes and shift rows steps occur before the final
            round key is applied.  Note that the mix columns step is omitted in the final round.  AES processes blocks of 128 bytes at a time so once
            the first block is encrypted subsequent block are encrypted the same way.  If the total number of bits to be encrypted cannot be broken
            evenly into 128 bit blocks the last block is padded with zeros.

        <h3>A Few Notes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                I am not a cryptographer, the following information is my understanding of the AES and may be incorrect. I suggest that you check this
                information against other sources if you are trying to learn about AES beyond simple curiosity.

                This post contains my code implementing AES, the code can also be found <a href = "https://github.com/ixonstater/learning_aes">here</a>
                on my github page. This code should NOT be used ANYWHERE unless you are trying to learn about AES. While the AES has never been cracked
                untested implementations can often be vulnerable to fascinating group of exploits known as side-channel attacks.

                My implementation of AES does not use secure cipher modes, instead it uses the "default" AES encryption mode ECB or Electronic Code Book.
                I will not cover different cipher modes in depth here as the do not affect the base AES algorithm, but you should note that using an
                insecure cipher mode can also lea
